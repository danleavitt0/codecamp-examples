# Summation

Write a program that finds the summation of every number between 1 and a user defined max number.

## Create

- Make a variable named `total` with the value `0`
- Make a variable named `maxNumber` and prompt the user to store a value
- Use a for loop to find the sum of all of the numbers between 1 and `maxNumber`


## Output

- Use `console.log` to print out the value of `total` after the for loop has run.

```js
The sum of all of the numbers between 1 and 64 is 2080

```
