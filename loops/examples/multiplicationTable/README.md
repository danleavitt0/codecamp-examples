# Multiplication Tables

Create a program that outputs the multiples 1-12 of a user inputted number

## Create

- Make a variable named `baseNumber` and prompt the user to store a value
- Make a `for` loop that repeats 12 times
- Each time the loop repeats, a new multiple should be calculated and outputted.

      Multiply the base number by the index (i) to find the multiple

## Output

- Use a `console.log` to output each time the for loop changes numbers

Example output:
```
12 x 1 = 12
12 x 2 = 24
12 x 3 = 36
12 x 4 = 48
12 x 5 = 60
12 x 6 = 72
12 x 7 = 84
12 x 8 = 96
12 x 9 = 108
12 x 10 = 120
12 x 11 = 132
12 x 12 = 144
```
