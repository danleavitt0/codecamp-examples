# Create your movie database!

It is your job to make a movie database that contains the fields:

    - Title (string)
    - Year (number)
    - Stars (array)

The movie database is an object of movie objects. This means that for each movie, the key is the name of the movie and the value is an object with those three fields.

## Display the information

Create a function called getMovieInfo that takes the name of a movie as a parameter
and displays the information in a sentence.

```js
getMovieInfo("Spiderman")
```

```
Spiderman was made in 2000 and is about Spiderman versus the Green Goblin.
This movie starts Tobey Maguire and James Franco
```

## Bonus

Use an `if/else` to check to make sure that the movie is in the database. If it
is not in the database, display a message that tells the user.Bonus

```
The movie Hercules is not in the database.
```
