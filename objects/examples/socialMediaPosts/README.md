# Social media posts

Create a social media posts array that is filled with post objects that have the following fields:

  - Author (string)
  - Title (string)
  - Date (string)
  - Content (string)


## Create the array

Define an array named `socialMediaPosts` that contains at least three objects. Each object should have the four fields mentioned above.

## Display the information

Create a function called getPosts that displays all of the post information from the array.
(HINT: You need a for loop to iterate through the array)

```js
getPosts(socialMediaPosts)
```

```
