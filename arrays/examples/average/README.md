# Find Average

## Information

To find the mean (average) of a set of numbers add all of the numbers together and divide by the number of values in the list.

For an example list of `1, 3, 5, 7`

1. Add all of the numbers
```
1+3+5+7 = 16
```
2. Divide by the number of values in the list. In this example there are 4 numbers in the list.
```
16/4 = 4
```
3. The mean (or average) of this list is 4

## Create

#### Variables

- Make a variable named `listLength` that prompts the user for a value
- Make a variable named `numList` that is an empty array

#### Functions

- Define a function named `getAverage`
  - Accepts one parameter (array)
  - Returns the average of the numbers from the list

## Call

Example function call:
```js
console.log(getAverage(numList))
```

## Output
Example output:
```
How many numbers in the list? 6
number: 1
number: 2
number: 3
number: 4
number: 5
number: 6
3.5
```
